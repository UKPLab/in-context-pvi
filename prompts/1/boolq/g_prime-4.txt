SENTENCE1: is kinetic energy a quantitative measure of inertia
SENTENCE2: Inertia -- By this formula, the greater its mass, the less a body accelerates under a given force. The masses defined by the above formulas are equal because the latter formula is a consequence of the former, if mass does not depend on time and velocity. Thus, "mass is the quantitative or numerical measure of a body's inertia, that is of its resistance to being accelerated".

SENTENCE1: has the canadian dollar ever been higher than the us dollar
SENTENCE2: Canadian dollar -- The gold standard was temporarily abandoned during the First World War and definitively abolished on April 10, 1933. At the outbreak of the Second World War, the exchange rate to the U.S. dollar was fixed at C$1.10 = US$1.00. This was changed to parity in 1946. In 1949, sterling was devalued and Canada followed, returning to a peg of C$1.10 = US$1.00. However, Canada allowed its dollar to float in 1950, whereupon the currency rose to a slight premium over the U.S. dollar for the next decade. But the Canadian dollar fell sharply after 1960 before it was again pegged in 1962 at C$1.00 = US$0.925. This was sometimes pejoratively referred to as the "Diefenbuck" or the "Diefendollar", after the then Prime Minister, John Diefenbaker. This peg lasted until 1970, after which the currency's value has floated.

SENTENCE1: is the nucleus the smallest part of an atom
SENTENCE2: Atom -- Every atom is composed of a nucleus and one or more electrons bound to the nucleus. The nucleus is made of one or more protons and typically a similar number of neutrons. Protons and neutrons are called nucleons. More than 99.94% of an atom's mass is in the nucleus. The protons have a positive electric charge, the electrons have a negative electric charge, and the neutrons have no electric charge. If the number of protons and electrons are equal, that atom is electrically neutral. If an atom has more or fewer electrons than protons, then it has an overall negative or positive charge, respectively, and it is called an ion.
