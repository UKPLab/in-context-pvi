SENTENCE1: is hershey ice cream made by hershey chocolate
SENTENCE2: Hershey Creamery Company -- Hershey Creamery Company, also known as Hershey's Ice Cream, is a creamery that produces Hershey's brand ice cream, sorbet, sherbet, and frozen yogurt, and other frozen treats such as smoothies and frozen slab style ice cream mixers. Founded by Jacob Hershey and four of his brothers in 1894 (all of whom have no relation to Milton S. Hershey and the chocolate company that he founded, also in 1894), it was taken over by the Holder family in the 1920s. The company was one of the first to offer consumers pre-packaged ice cream pints. In 1998, it modernized its operations to increase efficiency and reduce overhead. With their shared names and cities of origin, Hershey Creamery and Hershey Company have had a tumultuous relationship marked by multiple lawsuits over trademark issues. In the mid-1990s, the companies settled their most recent legal battles out of court, with the creamery agreeing to add a disclaimer to its ice cream products to note that it is not affiliated with The Hershey Company.
